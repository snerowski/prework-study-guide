# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created not only to give a brief crash course on what I can expect in the coming months for the bootcamp, but to also create simple guidelines that future students of varying programming experience can refer to. I want to be the best programmer I can be, so I tried to be as thorough as possible, but also not overload future users of the webpage with information. I built my webpage with as much attention to detail as possible, but also to use as a reference for myself. It will be impossible to retain ALL the information I learned in the prework modules, so I tried to include the most pertinent information to look back to. It helps solve the problem of entering the bootcamp completley blind, I and hopefully future students, now have a good base entering the bootcamp. I learned the basics of navigating the GitBash command line, the basics of HTML, CSS, VS code, as well as their origins.

## Usage

This webpage can be used as a good reference or refresher for the basics of Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It contains notes on all of these topics that myself, and future students can refer to. Future users can open the DevTools console and see the JavaScript running in real time, that lists the topics that I learned from all of the prework, and it will choose one topic for someone to study first.
